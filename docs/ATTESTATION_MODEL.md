## 1. Purpose  
This document defines the **attestation model** used inside the QuietWire GitHub Repository Management Platform.

Attestation =  
A cryptographically traceable record proving:  
- **What changed**  
- **Who changed it**  
- **When it changed**  
- **Why it changed**  
- **Where the evidence is stored**

Attestation flows:  
GitHub → CI → Evidence → CAP Event → Ledger Entry

| 1. Developer submits Pull Request (PR)                   |

                          v

| 2. CI pipeline runs and collects evidence                |
|    - SBOM                                                |
|    - Test results                                        |
|    - Build artifacts                                     |
|    - Reviewer approvals                                  |

| 5. CAP Event triggers creation of a Ledger entry         |

                          |
                          v

| 6. Ledger entry stored in /attestations/ledger/          |
|    (immutable, cryptographically linked)                |

## 3. Attestation Components  
A complete attestation must include:

### ✔ 3.1 Metadata  
Includes:
- Commit SHA  
- PR number  
- Contributor  
- Reviewer approvals  
- Branch  
- Timestamp (UTC)  

Stored in:

attestations/events/<timestamp>_metadata.json

---

### ✔ 3.2 Evidence Package  
Contains:
- CI logs  
- Test results  
- SBOM  
- Build artifacts  
- Review metadata  

Path example:

attestations/events/<timestamp>_evidence/

---

### ✔ 3.3 CAP Event (Human-readable summary)  
Generated by Raasid:

attestations/events/<timestamp>_cap_event.md

Includes:
- Summary of change  
- Evidence list  
- Direct links  
- Attestation hash  

---

### ✔ 3.4 Ledger Entry (Immutable)  
Stored in:

attestations/ledger/<timestamp>_ledger_entry.json

Includes:
- CAP event reference  
- Evidence hash  
- Canon-compliant attestation record  

---

## 4. Canon Rules for Attestation  
These rules must always be followed:

✔ Attestations are **immutable**  
✔ No manual editing of ledger entries  
✔ Every merge → must include evidence  
✔ Every release → must generate a CAP event  
✔ All timestamps use **UTC**  
✔ Evidence must match PR number  
✔ Ledger entries must be cryptographically linked

## 5. Ledger Structure

attestations/ events/ 2025-11-28/ metadata.json cap_event.md evidence/ logs.txt test_results.json sbom.json artifacts.zip ledger/ 2025-11-28/ ledger_entry.json

## 6. Role of AI Agents in Attestation

### Athena  
- Validates structure  
- Detects missing evidence  
- Checks Canon compliance  

### Raasid  
- Generates CAP event  
- Creates ledger entry  
- Signs attestation integrity  

### QueenBee  
- Ensures global consistency  
- Aligns attestation model with other repos
