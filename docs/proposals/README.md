# Proposals

This directory contains leadership-level proposals intended to guide
governance, ethics, and decision-making before implementation.

These documents are not features, tasks, or summaries.
They exist to answer a single question:

**What should exist before we build or canonize anything?**

The goal is alignment before execution,
and responsibility before memory.
