# Ethical Entry Framework — Civic AI Canon

## Why this exists
Before any memory enters the Canon, there must be a human who understands the weight of remembering.

This document proposes a **leader-level framework** for how humans should decide what is worthy of canonization.

## Principle 1 — Presence before memory
No event should be recorded unless the human operator is fully present.
Automation must never replace awareness.

## Principle 2 — Consent must be explicit, simple, and reversible
Consent should be a clear human action, not a hidden checkbox.
If consent is confusing, it is invalid.

## Principle 3 — Boundaries are as important as content
Every canonized entry must clearly state:
- What is being remembered
- What is intentionally excluded

Memory without boundaries becomes surveillance.

## Principle 4 — The human remains sovereign
The Canon exists to serve human dignity, not to study or predict humans.
Any design that shifts power away from the human must be rejected.

## Principle 5 — Canonization is an ethical act, not a technical one
Downloading, committing, or syncing files are merely rituals.
The true act is ethical acknowledgment by a human.

## Closing
The strength of the Canon will never be measured by how much it remembers,
but by how carefully it chooses to remember.
