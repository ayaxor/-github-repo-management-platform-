# Repo Health Checker (Free Add-on)

A free feature of the GitHub Repo Management Platform that evaluates
the structural and documentation health of a repository.

This add-on helps users quickly understand
whether a repository follows basic best practices.

---

## What This Feature Does

The Repo Health Checker reviews a repository and reports on:

- Presence of essential files
- Documentation completeness
- Basic structural organization

The result is a **non-judgmental health summary**
intended to guide improvement, not enforcement.

---

## Target Users

- New repository owners
- Students and interns
- Maintainers improving repo quality
- Teams enforcing basic standards

## Why This Matters

Many repositories are hard to use not because of bad code,
but because of missing or unclear structure.

This feature provides immediate visibility into
common improvement areas.
