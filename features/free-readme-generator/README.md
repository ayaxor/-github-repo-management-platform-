# README Auto-Generator (Free Add-on)

A free feature of the GitHub Repo Management Platform that helps users
generate clean, structured, and professional README files in minutes.

This add-on is designed to reduce friction for new repositories
and encourage better documentation practices by default.

---

## What This Feature Does

The README Auto-Generator allows users to:

- Select a project type (e.g. AI, Security, Documentation, Platform)
- Provide basic project information
- Instantly generate a structured README template
- Customize sections without starting from scratch

This feature is **free by default** and requires no configuration.

---

## Target Users

- New GitHub users
- Students and interns
- Engineers who want fast, clean documentation
- Teams standardizing repository quality

---

## Why This Matters

Many repositories fail not because of bad code,
but because of **poor or missing documentation**.

This feature ensures that every repository starts with:
- A clear purpose
- A readable structure
- Professional presentation

---

## Scope (v0.1)

Included:
- README template generation
- Multiple project categories
- Markdown-only output

Not included:
- Live preview
- GitHub API integration
- Paid customization

---

## Execution Model

This add-on is currently implemented as:
- Documentation-first
- Template-driven
- Ready for later automation

When development resources are available,
this logic can be converted directly into code.

## Status

**Feature Type:** Free Add-on  
**Stage:** Specification Complete
