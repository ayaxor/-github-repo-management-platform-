# Contributing Guidelines

## 1. Overview
These guidelines explain how contributors should work within this repository and maintain consistency across the QuietWire / Civic AI Canon ecosystem.

---

## 2. Branching Rules
- `main` is protected.  
  No direct commits. All changes must come through PRs.
- Use `feature/<name>` for new features.
- Use `hotfix/<name>` for urgent production fixes.
- Optionally use `develop` for integration work.

---

## 3. Pull Requests
- Every change MUST be submitted as a Pull Request.
- PRs must use the standard PR template.
- PRs must reference an issue:  
  Example: `Fixes #23`
- CI must pass (tests, lint, validations).
- At least one maintainer review is required.
- For critical updates, committers must produce attestation documentation.

---

## 4. Issues
- Use the Issue templates (bug, feature, doc).
- Provide clear acceptance criteria.
- Add correct labels (`type:*`, `area:*`, `difficulty:*`).
- Link any related architecture or SRS docs.

---

## 5. Documentation
- Update README, SRS, or `/docs` whenever behavior or structure changes.
- Apply bilingual strategy when needed (English primary, Arabic mirror).
- Ensure AI agents can understand file structure and metadata.

---

## 6. AI Agent Conduct
AI companions (Athena, Queen Bee, Raasid):

- MUST open Issues/PRs — no silent changes.
- MUST document any analysis or proposed changes.
- MUST avoid direct commits to `main`.
- SHOULD follow the AI Integration Protocol.
- MUST leave logs and structured output when possible.

## 7. Attestation Responsibilities
For critical work (releases, important changes):

- Create or update `/attestations/<version>/`  
- Include test results, logs, SBOMs, and evidence.
- Ensure links to CAP events and Ledger entries are clear.
