## Overview

This repository represents a **GitHub Repository Management Platform prototype**
designed for **QuietWire** and **Civic AI Canon** workflows.

The goal of this platform is to transform repository planning and documentation
from static text into a **clear, visual, and structured application concept**.

This project demonstrates how repository architecture, governance, and workflows
can be standardized before full automation or API integration.

---

## Platform Status

- **Current version:** `v0.1`
- **Stage:** Front-end application prototype
- **Focus:** Structure, clarity, and standardization

This version intentionally focuses on:
- Visual dashboard-style layout
- Clear platform direction
- Human-readable workflows
- Ready-to-use repository templates

Backend services and GitHub API integration are planned for later phases.

---

## Included Templates

This platform includes standardized templates for core QuietWire workstreams:

- **Mesh / Wirelight repositories**
- **Language learning programs**
- **Security & CAP analysis**
- **AI companion workspaces**

Each template provides:
- Recommended folder structure
- Required documentation files
- Security and governance guidance
- Clear definition-of-done criteria

Templates are located in the `/templates` directory.

---

## How to Use (Concept)

1. Identify the type of project you want to create  
   (Mesh, Language Program, Security/CAP, or AI Companion)

2. Open the corresponding template from the `/templates` directory

3. Customize names, scope, and documentation based on project needs

4. Use the platform UI (prototype) to visualize structure and workflow direction

---

## Design Philosophy

This platform is designed around the following principles:

- **Clarity over complexity**
- **Structure before automation**
- **Human-readable documentation**
- **Security and governance by design**

The application acts as a **thinking and planning layer**
before committing to production systems.

---

## Future Work

Planned future enhancements may include:

- Backend services
- GitHub API integration
- Automated repository creation
- Template-based file generation
- Activity logging and audit trails
- Governance and policy enforcement

These features are intentionally scoped as **next-phase development**.
