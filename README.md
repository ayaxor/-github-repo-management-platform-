4. Evidence & Attestation Lifecycle (Advanced)

Developer Action → Artifact Generated
       │
CI Pipeline → Evidence Extracted (logs, tests, SBOM)
       │
Raasid → Packages Evidence (CAP-Ready Format)
       │
CAP Engine → Creates Canon Event Record
       │
Ledger → Immutable Attested Entry

Standards enforced:

SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

Test artifacts

PR history

Reviewer signatures

Traceability links

5. Repository Governance Model

Branching Strategy

main        → Canon production branch (protected)
develop     → Optional integration branch
feature/*   → New work
hotfix/*    → Critical fixes

Review Policy

Min Reviewers: 2  
- Aya (Structural Review)  
- Ashraf (Architecture Review)

Merge Rules

No direct commits to main

All pipelines must pass

Attestation required for every release


Security Requirements

No secrets in repo

Mandatory GitHub secrets for tokens/keys

Protected branches enforced
